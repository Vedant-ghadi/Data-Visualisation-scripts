## Sheffield Clean Air Zone: NO₂ Pollution Analysis

This project evaluates the effectiveness of Sheffield's Clean Air Zone (CAZ), implemented on 27 February 2023, in reducing nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations. Using daily air quality data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), we apply interrupted time series regression and distributional analysis to quantify the intervention's impact on urban air quality.

### Research Questions

1. **RQ1 (CAZ Effectiveness)**: Did Sheffield's NO₂ concentrations significantly decrease after the CAZ implementation?
2. **RQ2 (Seasonal Patterns)**: Was the improvement consistent across all seasons, or concentrated in specific months?
3. **RQ3 (Distributional Impact)**: Beyond average reductions, did the proportion of WHO-compliant days actually increase?

### Key Messages

- **10.7% reduction** in mean NO₂ concentration (13.5 → 12.1 μg/m³)
- **Statistically significant** improvement (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21)
- **All 12 months** show decreased pollution post-CAZ
- **WHO-compliant days** increased from 45% to 62%
- **Unhealthy days** (>20 μg/m³) dropped from 18% to 8%

### Composite Visualisation

| Figure | Purpose | Key Finding |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Fig 1: Executive Dashboard** | Time series overview | 10.7% mean reduction with statistical significance |
| **Fig 2: ITS Regression** | Causal inference | Immediate drop + sustained decline post-intervention |
| **Fig 3: Slope Graph** | Monthly breakdown | All months improved; winter saw largest gains |
| **Fig 4: Sankey Diagram** | Distributional flow | Shift from unhealthy to WHO-compliant days |
